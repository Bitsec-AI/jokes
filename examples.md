# Bittensor Roast Material

## Specificity Jokes

These roast jokes work because they reference exact, real events and numbers.

- A subnet owner burned 2,500 TAO to register his revolutionary AI subnet. Six months later, the only intelligence it produced was the realization he should have kept the TAO.
- Bittensor's chain got hacked for $8 million through a fake Python package. Their response? Halt the entire "decentralized" blockchain with one phone call. Nothing says trustless like a kill switch.
- SN28 was supposed to be an AI subnet. Instead it became a meme coin, pumped to 7th place by market cap, then crashed 98% in hours when the foundation stepped in. Bittensor's killer app was a rug pull with extra steps.
- A miner spent $50,000 in registration fees, ran for three months, got deregistered, and lost everything. His subnet owner's response: "Have you tried re-registering?"
- Bittensor validators are supposed to evaluate miners independently. In practice, the top 5 validators just copy each other's weight matrices. It's peer review where every peer is cheating off the same paper.
- The dTAO upgrade was supposed to fix centralization. Within one month it enabled meme coin farming, broke tokenomics, and created new ways for subnet owners to extract value. The fix was worse than the disease.
- TAO went from $700 to $200. Then back to $700. Then back to $200. The only consistent thing about TAO's price is the disappointment.
- The December 2025 halving cut daily emissions from 7,200 TAO to 3,600 TAO. Miners now do the same work for half the pay. Just like a real job, except without the dental.

## Misdirection Jokes

Setup leads you one way, punchline goes another.

- Bittensor finally solved the Byzantine generals problem. Their solution: let one general at the OpenTensor Foundation make all the decisions. Problem solved.
- I asked a Bittensor miner what original code he contributed to his subnet. He said "git clone" is a contribution.
- Bittensor calls itself the decentralized OpenAI. They got the "no working product" part right.
- A subnet owner said his project would revolutionize AI. He was right. It taught thousands of people that AI tokens can go to zero just like regular tokens.
- Validators say they independently evaluate every miner. By "independently" they mean they all independently decided to copy the same guy's weights.
- The Bittensor whitepaper describes Yuma Consensus as an elegant mathematical framework. The implementation describes it as "if statements."

## Rule of Three Jokes

Two normal things, then an absurd third.

- Subnet owners promise three things: revolutionary AI, true decentralization, and a really creative way to set your TAO on fire.
- To be a successful Bittensor miner you need three skills: copy-pasting code, refreshing your emission balance, and panic-selling when you get deregistered.
- Bittensor has three types of participants: subnet owners who overpromise, miners who copy-paste, and validators who watch both groups and copy-paste anyway.
- The three stages of being a TAO holder: excitement at $700, denial at $400, and acceptance at $200.
- A Bittensor subnet needs three things to succeed: a whitepaper nobody reads, a Discord with more bots than users, and 2,500 TAO you'll never see again.
- There are three certainties in life: death, taxes, and your Bittensor miner getting deregistered the week after you set it up.

## Exaggeration Jokes

Take a real pain point and blow it up to absurd proportions.

- Registration costs 2,500 TAO. At peak prices that's $1.75 million to launch a subnet. For that money you could start an actual company, but where's the fun in having a working product?
- Bittensor miners are so good at copying code that if you put two of them in a room, they'd plagiarize each other's plagiarism until the code collapsed into a singularity of stolen work.
- The only thing more volatile than TAO's price is a subnet owner's promises. At least TAO only crashes 70%. Their roadmaps crash 100%.
- Weight copying is so rampant on Bittensor they had to build an entire cryptographic commit-reveal system to stop miners from cheating. Imagine building Fort Knox to stop people from copying homework.
- Bittensor is so decentralized that when they got hacked, one foundation halted the entire chain, reversed transactions, and told everyone it was fine. North Korea takes notes.
- Subnet owners burn $1 million in TAO to launch a subnet that gets 3 users, runs for 4 months, gets deregistered, and the owner calls it "a successful experiment in decentralized AI."

## Comparison Jokes

Compare Bittensor things to unexpected real-world equivalents.

- Bittensor's decentralization is like a puppet show where the puppeteer stands right next to you insisting the puppets have free will.
- Being a TAO holder is like being in a relationship with someone who keeps promising to change. Every pump is "this time it's different." It never is.
- A Bittensor subnet owner is just a crypto founder who couldn't afford Ethereum gas fees.
- Staking TAO is like lending your car to someone who already crashed two other cars. They promise they've learned, and you believe them because the APY looks good.
- The 64-validator oligarchy controlling all emissions is like calling a board meeting "direct democracy" because the board members voted.
- Yuma Consensus is like a group project where one person does the work and everyone else puts their name on it.

## Callback Jokes (Reference Well-Known Events)

These reference specific incidents the Bittensor community will instantly recognize.

- After the $8 million PyPI hack, Bittensor proved that their network is truly unstoppable. It only took one foundation employee to stop it.
- SN28 showed us the future of decentralized AI: meme coins with better tokenomics than the actual network.
- Remember when 64 validators controlled the entire network and everyone said dTAO would fix it? dTAO launched and now subnet owners control the entire network instead. Decentralization speedrun.
- The Bittensor halving was supposed to make TAO scarce and valuable. Instead it made miner profits scarce and complaints valuable.
- Barry Silbert called TAO a legitimate project. Parker Lewis called it a scam. Both were somehow equally wrong and equally right.
- The commit-reveal system was Bittensor's admission that their miners are so untrustworthy they need cryptography just to stop them from copying each other. Imagine needing encryption to prevent plagiarism.

## Short One-Liners

Quick-fire roasts for when you need something punchy.

- Bittensor: where "decentralized" means one foundation with a kill switch.
- TAO is proof that artificial intelligence and actual intelligence are not the same thing.
- The only thing Bittensor miners produce consistently is excuses for why they got deregistered.
- Subnet owners are just failed startup founders with a blockchain addiction.
- Bittensor fixed the validator centralization problem by creating new and exciting forms of centralization.
- The Bittensor whitepaper reads like a PhD thesis. The codebase reads like a Stack Overflow copy-paste.
- Nothing says "revolutionary AI" like a network whose biggest success was a meme coin.
- Bittensor's Yuma Consensus: because "majority rules" sounded too honest.
- Staking TAO is like paying for a gym membership you never use, except the gym also catches fire sometimes.
- I don't always lose money in crypto. But when I do, I make sure to do it on a "decentralized AI network" for extra irony.
