> Bittensor’s "death spiral" fear is a classic example of a crypto ecosystem’s self-fulfilling prophecy. When the value drops, the number of users decreases, the rewards diminish, and the number of people who want to hold the coin increases. Eventually, the whole thing collapses into a spiral of loss.

**Style:** Exaggeration Jokes  
**Factoid:** The "death spiral" fear: declining value → less participation → fewer rewards → more selling → death spiral. This alarm was raised at dTAO launch.
